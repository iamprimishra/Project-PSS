 ProLift Safety System: Ensuring Safe Ground Floor Landing in Lift Emergencies

 ## Introduction
Lifts or elevators are an indispensable part of modern life, especially in tall buildings, providing fast and convenient transportation between floors. However, they pose potential dangers in emergency situations like power failures or mechanical malfunctions. The Project PSS (ProLift Safety System) aims to address these safety concerns by designing and developing a lift security system that ensures a safe ground floor landing in case of emergencies.

## Features
**Normal Lift Operation**: Project PSS functions as a normal lift, allowing passengers to move to various floors using push buttons, ensuring convenient and efficient transportation in regular situations.
**Emergency Power Supply**: In the event of a power failure, an emergency power supply using a battery backup system kicks in, providing power to the lift's control panel and other essential systems. This ensures that the lift remains operational during power outages.
**Emergency Brake**: A critical safety feature of the system is the inclusion of an emergency brake. This mechanical brake automatically engages in case of a power failure or electrical malfunction, preventing the lift from uncontrolled movements and ensuring passenger safety.
**Buzzer Alert**: To notify passengers and lift operators about the emergency situation, a piezo buzzer is employed. It emits a loud sound to alert everyone within the vicinity of the lift, prompting them to take necessary precautions.
**Auto Landing at Ground Floor**: The landing controller, an electronic system, takes charge during emergencies and guides the lift's descent to ensure a safe landing at the ground floor. This feature avoids abrupt stops between floors, preventing potential injuries to passengers.
**Door Opening via Push Button**: After a safe landing at the ground floor, the lift's doors are automatically opened using a push button, enabling passengers to exit the lift safely.

## Components Used
**Arduino UNO**: The main microcontroller responsible for coordinating all the systems and components in the ProLift Safety System.
**Arduino NANO**: An additional microcontroller used for specific tasks and functions within the system.
**Side Shaft Motor & Pulley**: The primary motor responsible for lifting and lowering the elevator.
**Servo Motor**: Controls the door-opening mechanism in the lift.
**Piezo Buzzer**: Emits an audible alert in emergency situations to inform passengers and operators.
**Resistors (100 & 1K ohms)**: Used in various circuitry to manage current and voltage.
**L293D IC Motor Driver**: Facilitates motor control and direction in the system.
**Bread Board Large & Mini**: Provides a platform for prototyping and connecting electronic components.
**Push Buttons**: Enables passengers to select the desired floor within the lift.
**16x2 i2c LCD Display**: Displays essential information and messages to passengers and operators.
**9V Battery**: Powers the emergency backup system, ensuring functionality during power failures.
**Connecting & Jumper Wires**: Essential for establishing connections between various components in the system.

## Conclusion
Project PSS - ProLift Safety System addresses the safety concerns associated with lifts/elevators by offering an efficient and reliable solution for emergencies. By incorporating an emergency power supply, an automatic emergency brake, buzzer alerts, and precise landing control, the system ensures the safe de-elevation of passengers in case of power failures or malfunctions. The integration of advanced components like Arduino microcontrollers and motor drivers makes it a robust and practical safety enhancement for lifts, ensuring the well-being of passengers and operators alike.
